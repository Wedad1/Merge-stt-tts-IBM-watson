To carry out this task, I took the (speech to text) code that was implemented in the previous task, where its task is to capture the userâ€™s speech from the microphone and convert it to text in the text file. In on_close methode  in the (speech to text) code, I've put put the apikey, url, and assistant_id for the settings of the chat bot that was previously implemented and then extracted session_id and then wrote the code that will show the response massege from the chatbot by extracting the response message as shown in the code and saving it in a variable, then use this variable in the (text to speech) code to show the response in the mp3 file
